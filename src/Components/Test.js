    <h1>Background of Typhoid</h1>

    <p>A potentially fatal multisystemic infection known as enteric fever, often known as typhoid fever, is caused mostly by Salmonella enterica serotype typhi and, to a lesser extent, paratyphi A, B, and C. Salmonella are movable enterobacteriaceae that can cause a number of different gastrointestinal ailments. Typhoid, which is largely caused by Salmonella enterica serotype typhi and, to a lesser extent, S enterica serotypes paratyphi A, B, and C, is the most dangerous of them. From a severe septic infection to small instances of diarrhoea with low-grade fever, it can appear in a wide range of ways. Fever, malaise, widespread stomach pain, and constipation are characteristics of the typical presentation. Within a month, untreated typhoid fever can cause delirium, obtundation, intestinal bleeding, bowel perforation, and death.
